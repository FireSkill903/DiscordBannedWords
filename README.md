# DiscordBannedWords
Repo to crowdsource banned words on Discord (words that for instance take your Server out of Discovery if a channel name contains one of them)

If you came here to use the list:
THIS LIST LIKELY DOESN'T CONTAIN ALL WORDS THAT MAY CAUSE THE ISSUE. It is based solely on own brute-force research. (Especially at the start, as of now, the list is totally empty.)
If you want to use it - just download the .txt file and look for the words through your channel names.


If you want to help:
Just add words you found out were taking your Server out Discovery and/or out of being able to apply for partner. Others will do the rest.
